## 1. The $104B Problem

### **The Creator Economy is Broken**

| Platform | Creators | Revenue | Platform Fee | Key Problem |
|----------|----------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Patreon** | 250K | $3.5B | **15%** | High fees + censorship |
| **OnlyFans** | 3M | $5.5B | **20%** | Deplatforming risk |
| **YouTube** | 5M+ | $15B+ | **45%** | Demonetization |
| **Substack** | 2M | $300M+ | **10%** | Platform lock-in |

### **Core Issues**

💸 **Exploitative Fees**: Creators lose $15-20 of every $100  
🚫 **Censorship**: Patreon banned 200+ creators in 2021  
🔒 **No Ownership**: Platform owns content + audience data  
⏰ **Payment Delays**: 7-14 days, geographic restrictions
