Welcome to the Walrus Haulout Hackathon, hosted on DeepSurge - the new home for builders.


This online hackathon utilizes Sui’s core infrastructure - Walrus, Seal, and Nautilus - through dedicated tracks focused on data, AI, security, and trust. It’s also the first mainnet hackathon for Walrus, following the “Breaking the Ice” testnet hackathon.


What’s the hackathon is about
Haulout is designed to be low-friction and creative, giving developers the freedom to explore new ideas. You’ll be competing for over $100,000 in prizes, plus long-term opportunities through grants, incubation, and ecosystem support.


Prizes

Total Prize Pool: $105,000

Each track will award 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners, with the following prizes:


1st Place: $10,000

2nd Place: $7,500

3rd Place: $5,000


Best Tech Implementation: 3 winners: $5,000 each


Tracks & Focus Areas

Data Marketplaces 
Build decentralized markets for data. Focus on provable ownership, pricing, and exchange of datasets, with clear incentives for producers and consumers. 
Show us your 10x better approach to curation, quality incentives, and why users would choose decentralized over centralized platforms. Build a data market that preserves difficult-to-obtain data and protects free speech.


AI x Data 
Leverage AI with onchain data. Explore how real-time data and models can drive smarter dApps, adaptive systems, and new gameplay/financial loops. 
Show us how to democratize AI training using everyone's computers instead of centralized data centers. Build truly decentralized AI that trains across distributed compute and stores intermediaries on-chain


Provably Authentic (Truth Engine + Trust Oracle)
Authenticity onchain: verify provenance of media, create prediction markets for truth, or design AI trust oracles to prove source, training data, or reliability. 
Build systems that turn data into value, from decentralized storage and exchange to models that forecast real-world outcomes. Explore how prediction markets can incentivize accurate data reporting, create collective intelligence, or tie oracle reliability to market performance.


Data Security & Privacy
Protect users and data. Explore fraud detection, consumer protection, zero-knowledge proofs, verifiable storage, and compliance-aligned privacy solutions.


Bonus: Best Tech Implementation Awards for Walrus, Seal, and Nautilus.
