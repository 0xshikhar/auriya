Web3 Patreon (Seal + Walrus)

Overview
Creators today face high platform fees, restrictive monetization models, and a lack of direct ownership over their audience relationships. Fans have little transparency into how their money supports creators, and valuable content remains locked within centralized systems.



A decentralized Patreon built on the Sui Stack empowers creators to own their identity, content, and monetization rules — while giving fans transparent, verifiable access to exclusive material. 



The platform enables:

Direct creator–fan relationships without intermediaries.
Programmable monetization models adaptable to any content format.
Encrypted, verifiable content access based on clear, onchain rules.
Privacy-first architecture that protects both creator and fan data.
Global, censorship-resistant infrastructure to ensure long-term access.
